	<h1>About the Project</h1>
	<p>This project came about as a result of the chance discovery of two sources. One, a series of maps from the 1930's, showed the neighbourhoods in Chicago which had been 'redlined'; that is, deemed fit for unuse. The other was a series of tourist guides covering the city. I, Will, came up with the idea to combine the two.</p>
