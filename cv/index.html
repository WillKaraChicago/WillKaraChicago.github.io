	<p>The results for the North and West Side map were mixed. There was a focus on production and industry, where the routes took tourists among manufacturing plants and prominent production sites, emphasizing the industry and merchanidising taking place in Chicago. Additionally, the guides emphasize welfare by taking tourists to redlined districts that have public housing, mental institutes, juvenile reform schools, and a tuberculosis sanitarium. These seem like odd choices for tourists wanting to experience a new city, especially when placed in contrast to the emphasis on architecture amongst most of the tour stops. However, considering these tours were created by a New Deal agency, the writers could have intended to emphasize the public welfare citizens of Chicago received through these places.</p>

	<p>The results of the South Chicago map were surprising. Not only did tourist trails go right through redlined districts, but the writers seemed to make a clear decision to send tourists to important sites of African American history- schools, monuments, etc. This leads us to believe that the guidebook had a liberal focus. However, frequent use of terms such as “Negro district” are problematic- they imply that the target audience for the tourist guides were not African Americans, but rather a white audience. On top of this, the fact that the tour trails are meant to be completed by car implies that they are meant for a more well-heeled clientele.</p>
