	<h1>Redlining and Tourism in 1939 Chicago</h1>
	<p>This project aims to look at one of America's most diverse cities, Chicago, by examine the links between redlined districts and tourism in the city. <br>
		Between 1935 and 1940, a New Deal agency, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, color-coded over 250 maps to indicate the credit-worthiness of districts. Real estate developers and mortgage lenders were consulted in the creation of these maps, with the intent to prevent foreclosures and refinance homes, using criteria such as income levels and racial demography to determine the grade each district received. These practices resulted in redlined districts where mortgages were deemed too high of a risk to distribute, which affected neighborhood development.</p>
